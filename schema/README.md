# Schema

These schema are the ones needed to validate Swagger 2.0 documentation without requiring access to the internet.

If the Swagger 2.x schema updates then the files here should also be updated. Any file matching `*-schema.json` will be loaded as a JSON Schema file (and will cause errors if it does not validate itself)
